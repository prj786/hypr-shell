# ── Toolkit theming env — MUST be exported HERE, before `exec Hyprland`, not only
#    via hl.env() in hyprland.lua. hl.env applies to Hyprland's children, but its
#    propagation is unreliable for apps launched on-demand. The exact symptom of
#    that miss: Qt/KDE apps (Dolphin) show the right ICONS — KIconLoader reads
#    ~/.config/kdeglobals [Icons] directly — but a WHITE palette, because
#    QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME never reached them, so qt6ct's Breeze widget style was
#    never applied and Qt fell back to the light default Fusion palette (which
#    ignores kdeglobals colours). Exporting here puts these in the real process
#    environment of Hyprland AND every descendant, however it's spawned.
#    Keep in sync with scripts/colorscheme.sh (writes the qt6ct.conf + kdeglobals
#    these point at) and ~/.icons/default (cursor inheritance).
